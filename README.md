# Deflender
A controller for DefleMask. Dynamically arranges note structure by key and scale. Most definitely not a MIDI controller.

# What works right now:
Scale Selection Button - Scrolls through the canon scales and wraps around to first.
Key Selection Buttons - Starts the scale at the key selected from the pad
Play Buttons - Plays 8 notes, starting at the key selected, and progressing through the selected scale

# What's next:
Scale Selection Buttons - Scroll through a list of scales without wrapping around, by adding a decrement button
Octave Selection Buttons - Raise and lower the octave in Deflemask through a set of buttons
Instrument Selection Buttons - Scroll through a list of instruments in Deflemask through a set of buttons
LCD Screen - Display the selected Scale and Key for less ambiguous usage
Raspberry Pi - Integrate a Raspberry Pi running Deflemask at startup, essentially making this a standalone instrument.
????? - More features if I think of them.

# Parts:
Teensy 3.1
21 buttons (and counting)
Lots of RobotGeek Workbenches
